To run the programs, build using `make` and you can execute the programs.

> The `.s` files use `_start` label to run the assembly programs. The `.gcc.s` files use `main` to run the programs. I have changed the extension to make it easier for the Makefile to perform compilation. The `.gcc.s` programs use `gcc`, the `.s` labelled programs use `as`.
